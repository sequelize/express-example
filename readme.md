# Sequelize examples with Express

This repository presents two examples of using [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) in projects with [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express#readme).

* [Blog](https://github.com/sequelize/express-example/tree/master/blog): This project follows an MVC folder structure. It does not use `sync` and uses migrations and has no seeds.
* [Orchestra](https://github.com/sequelize/express-example/tree/master/orchestra): This project follows a modular folder structure. It uses `sync` as well as seeds.

* Submit a PR with more examples!
