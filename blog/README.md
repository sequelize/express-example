# Blog: Sequelize + Express

This is an example of how to setup Sequelize and Express together in a project for NodeJS 10 and above.

Some features of this example

* It uses migrations
* It does not use `.sync()`
* It initializes the models in the `index.js` folder

Feel free to download this and use as a starting point for your new project!

This example uses PostgreSQL as a database engine.

## See it in action

* Install PostgreSQL and run `$ createdb sequelize-blog`
* Install project dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn install`
* Run the migrations `$ sequelize db:migrate`
* Run the express server with `npm start`
* Open your browser in `localhost:3000` and explore. Review the `routes` files to see what endpoints are available.
